# CodingChronicles_CPP

This is the third edition of Coding Chronicles! I am putting C# on a backburner for a second in order to develop my skills with C++. Since C# and Java are extrememly similar, I figured it would be in my best interest to move on, for now, to C++. After this, I will probably start a Python chronicle, but we will see!
